About me
======
👋 Hello! I'm Amal Hussain, a 4th-year student at UMBC pursuing a BS in Environmental Science and a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems.

🌱 I'm passionate about the geosciences field, with a focus on environmental remediation, climate change mitigation, renewable energy, wildlife conservation, and ocean science.

💼 Post-graduation, I aspire to work in geoscience roles that tackle environmental challenges and contribute to conservation efforts.

🔬 My skills include Python, C++, ArcGIS, QGIS, ENVI, Solidworks, MATLAB, and R/RStudio. I utilize these tools to research and analyze environmental issues like changes in air and water temperature, island inundation, and coral bleaching.

📚 I enjoy researching and writing, leveraging my experiences in classes and internships to explore and understand complex environmental problems.

🔗 Check out my portfolio [Portfolio URL] for demonstrations of the skills I've utilized in various projects.

Let's make a positive impact on our planet together! 🌍


[this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
