About me
======
üëã Hello! I'm Amal Hussain, a 4th-year student at UMBC pursuing a BS in Environmental Science and a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems.

üå± I'm passionate about the geosciences field, with a focus on environmental remediation, climate change mitigation, renewable energy, wildlife conservation, and ocean science.

üíº Post-graduation, I aspire to work in geoscience roles that tackle environmental challenges and contribute to conservation efforts.

üî¨ My skills include Python, C++, ArcGIS, QGIS, ENVI, Solidworks, MATLAB, and R/RStudio. I utilize these tools to research and analyze environmental issues like changes in air and water temperature, island inundation, and coral bleaching.

üìö I enjoy researching and writing, leveraging my experiences in classes and internships to explore and understand complex environmental problems.

üîó Check out my portfolio [Portfolio URL] for demonstrations of the skills I've utilized in various projects.

Let's make a positive impact on our planet together! üåç


[this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 



For more info
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
