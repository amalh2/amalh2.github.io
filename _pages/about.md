About me
======
👋 Hello! I'm Amal Hussain, a 4th-year student at UMBC pursuing a BS in Environmental Science and a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems.

🌱 I'm passionate about the geosciences field, with a focus on environmental remediation, climate change mitigation, renewable energy, wildlife conservation, and ocean science.

💼 Post-graduation, I aspire to work in geoscience roles that tackle environmental challenges and contribute to conservation efforts.

🔬 My skills include Python, C++, ArcGIS, QGIS, ENVI, Solidworks, MATLAB, and R/RStudio. I utilize these tools to research and analyze environmental issues like changes in air and water temperature, island inundation, and coral bleaching.

📚 I enjoy researching and writing, leveraging my experiences in classes and internships to explore and understand complex environmental problems.

Let's make a positive impact on our planet together! 🌍
