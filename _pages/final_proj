Introduction 
======
For my final project, I decided to study wildfires in California due to this natural 
disaster being very frequent and severe in this state, especially in the past 5-10 
years. Climate change has been intensifying many natural disasters in the US due 
to warmer temperatures and drier seasons bringing on longer and more intense 
drought seasons. Additionally, human activities are burning more fossil fuels, 
releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere like carbon dioxide that help 
in thickening earth’s ‘blanket’ so more solar energy is retained—heating up the 
planet. It is astonishing that “…more than half of the 20 largest fires in California 
history all took place in the last four years” (Lai, 2022) and in 2020 in particular, 
10,122,336 acres of land burned from 58,950 total fires in the state (National 
Interagency Fire Center). One 2020 fire in particular caught my interest—the 
massive fire in El Dorado County, CA that was actually the result of irresponsibly 
used pyrotechnics at a gender reveal party. 


Data & Methods
======
<ul>
  <li> Acquired data from U.S Census bureau, Kaggle.com, USGS Earth explorer </li>
  <li> Tried to replicate map from Washington Post and FEMA on wildfire risks by county </li>
  <li> Created 2019 map of California wildfire incidence </li>
  <li> Used census data to filter out racial demographic data for El Dorado county, CA </li>
  <li>Calculated median household income and planar point pattern of California’s wildfire sites</li>
  <li>Applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess goodness-of-fit </li>
  <li>Attempted, did not complete, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculation 
to measure the vegetation health/cover during the El dorado fire. </li>
  <li>Determined the relationship of the socioeconomic variables to each other and wildfire frequency. </li>
</ul>

Conclusion & future work
======
After generating the Cali maps and doing the NDVI calculations, it showed that 
the El dorado wildfire was very destructive, the community most likely affected 
by this incident where white people that have wildfire resiliency plans, and there 
most likely was vegetative burn/damage during and post the fire. To conclude, the 
work I did in my R Markdown demonstrated that El Dorado’s communities are 
vulnerable to wildfire damage and more people living in a county/region of 
California correlated to higher incidence of wildfires. Due to the dominant racial 
group in El Dorado being whites, I am assuming that during and post the wildfire, 
these communities were probably equipped with the necessary resources like 
insurance, money, shelter, etc. and could sustain themselves during and post the 
fire. In the future, I would like to do a more complete assessment
of income vs. race in El Dorada, more statistical analysis, find 
documentation/insurance claims of specific burn damage, include other variables like air pollution and impacts 
from wildfires, and actually carry through the NDVI calculation to form a more holistic view of the outcomes of this 
wildfire
