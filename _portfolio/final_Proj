This basic map shows the incidence of wildfires in California in 2019 with El Dorado, the county of interest, being highlighted. 
The work on this project is incomplete, but it aimed to analyze the damage from the 2020 El Dorado fire through normalized difference 
vegetation index (NDVI) calculations, as well as comprehensive comparisons of demographic and socioeconomic features of El Dorado community members.
